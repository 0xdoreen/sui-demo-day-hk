## Project Description 

### Brief

Mole is the first DeFi on Aptos and Sui providing leveraged yield farms & funds.

Mole provides users with safe investment products with different risk levels including followings.

Savings: provide secure and stable investment return.

Leverage yield farming: provide multiple strategies under different market fluctuations.

Funds: hedge market risks with high yield revenue.

### Savings

Savings products provide users with the most stable investment income. Users deposit their token assets to earn two kinds of rewards.
Although savings may not produce the biggest return, they are the most stable and reliable products over time. When the bear market goes down, full of heavy rainstorm, you will love the savings products more and more.

### Leveraged yield farming

Mole leveraged yield farming is prepared to provide you a dragon slayer in order to protect you from the carnage that is now taking place in the world of investments.

Mole leveraged yield farming is aimed to make the most use of loan borrowed from savings products. The loan is used as a lever to magnify the impact of users' own yield farming investment. The goal is to earn a higher rate of return while simultaneously paying a certain amount of borrowing interests on the loan.

Leveraging is risky. However, users are able to avoid investment risks with well-designed strategies. Users can receive larger returns while taking a lower risk with good strategies.

### Funds

Mole currently offers 3 types of 5 funds:

a) Type 1 : Robust stable, dual stable tokens
It contains Bond Fund.

b) Type 2 : Neutralize market volatility risk:
It contains Balanced Funds and Hedge Funds.

c) Type 3 : 1x exposure, following mainstream token price fluctuations:

It contains Trend Funds and Index Funds.

Mole funds make all of the related operations automatic. The industrious and brave little Mole silently endures all the ascetic life of adjusting positions accompanying to the market volatility. It brings you high yield farming income. More important, these funds will not have the risk of liquidation. Amazing world!
