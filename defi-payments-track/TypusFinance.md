## Project Description
Typus is a real yield infrastructure that integrates swap, lending, and derivatives building on top of the Sui ecosystem.

### Why we’re building Typus
Passive LP solutions are critical in achieving scalable liquidity, but there are no liquid hedging instruments in place to control risk exposures. Providing liquidity should not come with the same risks as speculators. Typus is creating a DeFi-native primitive to transfer risk so that LPs can provide liquidity smoothly.

### MVP
Typus’ first product is a DeFi Option Vault (DOV) with Dutch Auction implemented to simplify retail users’ decision making process. By establishing an options marketplace for longtail assets, Typus provides enhanced risk rewards for LPs and deepens liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem.

### Practical Applications of Typus
1. Projects: an innovative approach to project token releases through Typus’ covered call vaults
2. AMM LPs: enhancing Sharpe Ratio and improving risk rewards through Typus’ LP tools
3. Lending Protocols: elevating LTV for longtail assets (including NFTs) in lending
4. NFT Issuers: providing extra premiums on launches and adding a fun gamified layer to NFT releases
