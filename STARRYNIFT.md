**General Introduction**

StarryNift is a gamified metaverse co-creation platform, bringing you immersive 3D virtual experiences where you can Play, Create and Socialize. The pre-Series A round is led by Susquehanna International Group, followed by Binance Labs, and BNB Chain Fund.

StarryNift can provide communities and brands to build fully customizable 3D metaverse scenes, thus empowering users to leverage 3D scenes combined with interactivities for content sharing, community building, and project branding. 

StarryNift also integrates evolvable Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) empowered by on-chain and off-chain data processing and analysis to plot accurate user profiles to facilitate a flexible marketing strategy. 

We welcome projects to collaborate with us to host events such as AMA, virtual galleries, immersive concerts, social games, and more. With pooled resources, we hope that we'll be able to provide users with more scenes to explore, more services to utilize, and more features and functions to socialize.
