### Demo Day - April 16th

Will invite and select a panel of judges who can attend the demo day in person, from Sui Foundation, Mysten, partner organizations, VC’s, institutions, etc. 
It’s preferable for external judges to outnumber Sui/Mysten judges to maintain neutrality 
The actual demo period will be 2-4 hours (with ample breaks in between) depending on how many entries we get
Let’s use 3 hours for example
8 minutes per project, ~25 projects
We can adjust the total time period and time per project depending on number of teams toward the end of registration period
Live scoring is done on a number of criteria (drop lowest and highest scores and compute total scores, etc.)
Determine category winners based on score tallies
Announce winners (pending KYC)  on the same day before the end of the builder house
